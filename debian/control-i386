Description: Monitor your sitting position and get a warning when you slouch or hunch.
 Keera Posture uses the webcam to compare your posture to a reference
 posture set by you during calibration. When it differs too much for a
 long time, it shows a transparent, overlay message to warn you. When
 you sit back correctly, the message goes away.
 .
 This program might help people who suffer from back and neck pain
 by regularly reminding them that they must sit properly. However,
 please be aware that:
 .
 1) No promises are made. For all we know, this program could blow
 up your house. We deny any responsibility from any usage of this program.
 .
 2) You must callibrate the program for it to work. If you move your
 chair or webcam frequently, you may have to recalibrate the program.
 .
 3) The program does not know how you should sit, only how you did
 sit when you calibrated it. Therefore, you need to first find out
 how to sit properly when you work in front of your computer. Google
 for ergonomy and take it from there.
 .
 Keera Posture lives in the tray-bar. The icon's colour is used
 to show relevant information, and moving the mouse over that icon
 shows other relevant details. The right-click menu allows you to
 configure the basic settings and calibrate the program. A single,
 normal click allows you to enable/disable tracking.
 .
 CPU consumption is low. It takes about 2 frames per second, it processes
 them, and then discards them.
 . 
 This program does not transfer your images to our servers. If something
 does not work as advertised, we're really going to need your help. Please,
 get in touch, describe the problem, and we'll take it from there. But
 before you ask: no, we cannot see through your webcam, we cannot see
 what they program is recording, not even if you ask us to or if you
 authorise us. That feature simply does not exist, and we do not want to
 implement it.
 .
 At the present time, a semi-recent version of the code is available but,
 ironically, this is All Rights Reserved. See, I told you it would be
 ironic. Anyway, we are considering different licensing/business models
 and we would like to hear your thoughts. Seeing as this could be one of
 the first mainstream commercial Haskell programs, we are in a unique
 position. On the other hand, we use almost exclusively free software and
 we want to be part of that community. The possibility of dual-licensing or
 free or FOSS personal license and pay and closed Business licenses
 is on the table. If you happen to have a company and have a suggestion
 with respect to a business model that would be fair to both sides,
 please let us know.
