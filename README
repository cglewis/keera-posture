Welcome to Keera Posture

This application tries to detect your posture while you sit and warns you when
it deviates too much from a reference posture given during configuration. It
may be used, among other things, to help us detect when we are sitting in a
straining position.

Dependencies:
* gtk-helpers (http://github.com/keera-studios/gtk-helpers)
* keera-hails (http://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails)

Install those by downloading, extracting and running cabal install from inside
their dirs.

After that, download keera-posture and install it with cabal install.

Calibration
===========
The first time you run the program, you have to calibrate it. Just sit how you
think you should sit (and consult a physician if you don't know how to sit
properly) and right-click on its icon, and click on "Calibrate". Follow the
assistant, and the program will detect you and record your position.

After that, the position will be saved in a config file and the program will
warn you (using sound, a window and/or changing the tray icon) when your
posture is too different from what it was when you calibrated the program.

Test the program. The placement of your webcam and the amount of light
in the room can influence the accuracy of this system, so feel free to
experiment and find out how to get better results. Also, if you can think of
new features that might be useful, go online and open a ticket on the program's
github page.
